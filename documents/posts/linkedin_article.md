# Finding Your Next Research Opportunity: How ScholarMap is Changing the Game for Biomedical Scientists

**[PLACEHOLDER: Hero image - World map with glowing research hotspots]**

## The Challenge Every Researcher Faces

As a PhD student or postdoc in biomedical sciences, you've probably asked yourself these questions:

- *Where are the leading labs in my field located?*
- *Which cities have the strongest research communities?*
- *Should I target institutions in the US, Europe, or Asia?*
- *Who are the active researchers I should connect with?*

Finding answers to these questions traditionally meant hours of manual research, browsing institution websites, and asking around in your network. But what if you could see the entire global research landscape at a glance?

## Introducing ScholarMap

I'm excited to share **ScholarMap** - a platform that maps global biomedical research opportunities by analyzing 36+ million PubMed publications.

Instead of searching for papers, ScholarMap answers the crucial question: **"Where are the researchers?"**

## How It Works

ScholarMap uses AI to:

1. **Parse your research interests** into comprehensive PubMed queries
2. **Extract geographic data** from author affiliations across millions of publications
3. **Map researchers** by country, city, and institution
4. **Visualize the landscape** with an interactive 3D map

**[PLACEHOLDER: Infographic showing the 4-step process]**

The result? A comprehensive view of where your field is most active, helping you make informed decisions about your next career move.

## Real Use Cases
