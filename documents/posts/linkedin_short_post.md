## 版本 1: 问题导向型（推荐）

**[PLACEHOLDER: World map with research hotspots]**

**Where should I apply for my postdoc?**

This is the question I heard countless times from PhD students and early-career researchers.

The answer? Usually "the usual suspects" - institutions everyone knows.

But what if you're missing 80% of the opportunities simply because you don't know where to look?

That's why I built **ScholarMap** 🗺️

📊 **What it does:**
- Maps 36+ million PubMed publications
- Shows researcher distribution by country/city/institution
- Reveals hidden gem labs and emerging research hubs
- Helps you make data-driven career decisions

🔬 **Current Coverage:**
→ 150+ countries  
→ 400+ cities  
→ 950+ institutions  
→ Millions of researchers  

💡 **Real Example:**
"I thought only US and UK were options for BCI research. ScholarMap showed me 900+ researchers in China and strong communities in Germany and Canada I never knew existed."

Whether you're:
- 🎓 Planning your next academic move
- 🌍 Seeking international opportunities
- 🤝 Finding research collaborators

ScholarMap gives you the complete picture.

## 版本 2: 故事型

**[PLACEHOLDER: Before/After comparison]**

**From 40 hours of research to 40 minutes.**

Last month, a PhD student reached out:

*"I'm finishing my degree in neural modulation. I've spent weeks googling labs, but how do I know if I'm missing opportunities?"*

This is the problem with traditional job searching in academia:
- ❌ Fragmented information
- ❌ Name-recognition bias  
- ❌ No comparative view
- ❌ Time-consuming manual research

So we built **ScholarMap** to solve this.

**Instead of searching for papers, it answers: "Where are the researchers?"**

🔍 **How it works:**
1. Analyzes 36M+ PubMed publications
2. Extracts researcher locations from affiliations
3. Maps them by country → city → institution
4. Shows you the complete landscape

**The result?**

That PhD student discovered:
✅ 3 emerging research hubs she never considered  
✅ 15 institutions perfectly aligned with her interests  
✅ 50+ potential collaborators in her target cities  

All in under an hour.

**Free to use. Built by scientists, for scientists.**

## 版本 3: 数据驱动型

**[PLACEHOLDER: Statistics infographic]**

**Did you know?**

📊 The average PhD student explores **<10 institutions** when job searching.

But there are **950+ institutions** actively publishing in biomedical sciences.

**That's 95% of opportunities unseen.** 👀

We built **ScholarMap** to change this:

🌍 **Current Database:**
• 150+ countries mapped
• 400+ cities covered  
• 950+ institutions indexed
• Millions of researchers tracked

🔬 **Research Fields:**
• Brain-Computer Interfaces
• Neural Modulation
• CRISPR Gene Editing
• Cancer Immunotherapy
• AI in Drug Discovery
• + More

🎯 **Use Cases:**
→ PhD students planning postdocs  
→ Postdocs seeking positions  
→ PIs finding collaborators  
→ International students exploring options  

**The platform is free.**  
**The insights are priceless.**

## 版本 5: 个人故事型

**[PLACEHOLDER: Personal photo or team photo]**

**Why I built ScholarMap:**

As a researcher, I watched talented students and postdocs make career decisions based on:
- Name recognition only
- Limited geographic knowledge  
- What their advisor happened to know
- The "usual suspects"

**They were missing 90% of opportunities simply because they were invisible.**

So I asked: What if we could map the entire biomedical research landscape?

After analyzing **36 million PubMed publications**, ScholarMap was born.

📍 **What we've discovered:**
• Hidden research hubs in unexpected cities
• Emerging institutions outpacing traditional powerhouses
• Strong research communities in overlooked regions
• Global networks waiting to be connected

🎯 **The mission:**
Make global research opportunities visible, accessible, and navigable for everyone.

**Free to use. Open to all.**
